#Infinite Precision Multiplication

The problem is how to multiply two positive natural numbers with infinitely many digits specified in any-base number system. The solution involves reading the numbers from an input file and storing each digit in linked lists. These linked lists facilitate efficient digit-by-digit multiplication and handling of carries, leveraging their dynamic nature to manage infinite lengths and any base system. The final product is constructed from the linked lists and converted back into a format in the specified base.
